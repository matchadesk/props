    {
      "question": "How do payouts work?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the scaling plan?",
      "answer": "Topstep's scaling plan allows you to increase your position sizes and account sizes as you demonstrate consistent profitability. This is applied to both evaluation and funded accounts.",
      "source": "https://help.topstep.com/en/articles/8284223-what-is-the-scaling-plan"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there an activation fee?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I hit the drawdown limit?",
      "answer": "If you hit the maximum drawdown limit, your account will be reset. You can purchase a reset for the same price as a new evaluation account.",
      "source": "https://help.topstep.com/en/articles/8284207-what-is-the-daily-loss-limit-and-what-happens-if-i-exceed-it"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the consistency rule?",
      "answer": "The consistency rule requires you to maintain profitable trading days. For evaluation accounts, you need to maintain 50% consistency to pass to the funded phase.",
      "source": "https://help.topstep.com/en/articles/8284208-what-is-the-consistency-target"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I trade during news events?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the minimum trading days to pass evaluation?",
      "answer": "Topstep requires a minimum of 2 trading days to pass evaluation due to the Consistency Target requirement. The Combine can be completed in as little as two trading days because of this consistency rule.",
      "source": "https://www.topstep.com/faq/"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why must all new Combines use TopstepX after 7 Jul 2025?",
      "answer": "From 7 July 2025 TopstepX becomes the only supported platform; no new Combines can be bought on other platforms, easing support and improving funded-trader outcomes.",

    {
      "question": "What happens to legacy Quantower or NinjaTrader Combines after 1 Aug 2025?",
      "answer": "After 1 Aug 2025 resets are possible only in TopstepX; failing an account on another platform means you must open the next Combine on TopstepX.",
