    {
      "question": "What is the difference between Rapid and Legacy accounts?",
      "answer": "Rapid accounts have no daily loss limit and use end-of-day trailing drawdown, while Legacy accounts have daily loss limits and use intraday trailing drawdown. Rapid accounts are more flexible but require stricter risk management.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How do payouts work?",
      "answer": "Payouts are available after 5 trading days with minimum profit requirements. The split is 50/50 until you reach 30 Benchmark Days, then you keep 100% of profits. Minimum payouts range from $250 to $500 depending on account size.",
      "source": "https://fundednext.com/futures"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are Benchmark Days?",
      "answer": "Benchmark Days are profitable trading days that count toward your 30-day requirement. Once you reach 30 Benchmark Days, your profit split increases from 50/50 to 100% in your favor.",
      "source": "https://fundednext.com/futures"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there an activation fee?",
      "answer": "No, there are no activation fees for FundedNext accounts. You only pay the one-time evaluation fee to start trading.",
      "source": "https://fundednext.com/futures"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I hit the drawdown limit?",
      "answer": "If you hit the maximum drawdown limit, your account will be reset. You can purchase a reset for the same price as a new evaluation account.",
      "source": "https://fundednext.com/futures"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the consistency rule?",
      "answer": "FundedNext has a 40% consistency rule. This means a single day's profit cannot make up more than 40% of the total profit target.",
      "source": "https://fundednext.com/futures"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the different account types?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Can I trade during news events?",
      "answer": "News trading is allowed in the Challenge Phase. For funded accounts, news trading is permitted but triggers a News-Profit-Split rule with reduced split on profits booked within the event window. High-impact events are those flagged red on the Forex Factory calendar.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the minimum trading days to pass evaluation?",
      "answer": "FundedNext requires 3 days minimum to pass evaluation due to the 40% consistency rule. Your biggest day cannot exceed 40% of the profit target, requiring at least 3 trading days to meet this requirement.",
