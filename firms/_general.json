        "answer": "For urgent issues (payout status, platform disconnections), use live chat or Discord for fastest response. Most firms offer 24/7 live chat (FundedNext, DayTraders, Alpha Futures). Discord communities are also very active for day-to-day updates and quick questions.",

        "question": "What are the different news trading policies across prop firms?",
        "answer": "News trading policies vary significantly: Most firms allow news trading (Apex, Tradeify, Topstep, DayTraders, Lucid, FundedNext) with general caution warnings. Some have specific restrictions: Alpha Futures (+/-2 minutes around high-impact events), FundingTicks (+/-1 minute for Tier-1 events), TPT (+/-1 minute for specific events), and MFFU (+/-2 minutes around any data release). Firms with restrictions typically void profits or close accounts for violations.",

        "question": "Which firms have the most restrictive news trading policies?",
        "answer": "My Funded Futures has the most restrictive policy - all accounts must be flat +/-2 minutes around any data release with account breach for violations. Take Profit Trader requires being flat +/-1 minute around CPI, NFP, FOMC minutes, plus Crude-Inventory & Bond-Auction blocks. Alpha Futures has +/-2 minute restrictions for high-impact events.

        "question": "What is the best evaluation account for beginners and why?",
        "answer": "Topstep and My Funded Futures are the best for beginners. Topstep offers excellent scaling plans, clear 2-day minimum requirement, and 100% profit up to $10K then 90/10. MFFU has no activation fees, simple one-time payment structure, and end-of-day trailing drawdown that becomes static after first payout. Both firms have straightforward rules and excellent customer support, making them ideal for traders new to prop trading.",

    {
        "question": "What are the best evaluation options for experienced traders?",
        "answer": "Apex Trader Funding is the best option because it allows up to 20 funded accounts simultaneously and uses intra-day trailing drawdown which is more difficult overall vs EOD. Apex also offers 100% profit splits, no minimum trading days (can pass in 1 day), and no consistency rule during evaluation. Other strong options include Tradeify for fastest path (1 day minimum) with flexible news trading, FundedNext for withdrawal caps until 5 payouts then 100% of profits, and DayTraders for 100% profit splits with larger account sizes up to $300K.",

        "question": "Which firms offer the best value for 50k accounts considering total costs?",
        "answer": "Best value depends on timeframe: For quick funding (1-2 months): Tradeify Advanced at $194 total cost. For long-term (6+ months): FundedNext at $59/month with no activation fee. For one-time payment: DayTraders S2F at $370.50 with no ongoing fees. My Funded Futures at $77 one-time fee offers good value for those who prefer no monthly costs. Consider profit splits too - Apex and DayTraders offer 100% profit splits which can offset higher initial costs.",

    },
    {
        "question": "How do consistency rules work in prop trading?",
        "answer": "Consistency rules prevent traders from passing evaluation with a single large winning day. For example, a 50% consistency rule means your biggest trading day cannot exceed 50% of your total profit target. If you need $3,000 profit target, your biggest day can't exceed $1,500. This ensures you demonstrate consistent trading ability over multiple days rather than getting lucky once. Most firms use 20-50% consistency rules, with 50% being most common.",

    },
    {
        "question": "What are the different drawdown modes and how do they work?",
        "answer": "Drawdown modes determine how your maximum loss limit is tracked: 1) End-of-Day (EOD) Trailing - calculated at market close and moves up with your profits, giving you more room as you succeed. 2) Intraday Trailing - real-time monitoring that moves up with profits, account closes if you hit the limit during trading. 3) Static - fixed amount that never changes, no trailing movement. Most firms use EOD trailing as it's more flexible, while intraday trailing is stricter but provides real-time protection.",

    },
    {
        "question": "What are profit targets and how do they work?",
        "answer": "Profit targets are the amount you need to earn to pass evaluation. For example, a $3,000 profit target on a $50K account means you must earn $3,000 in profits while staying within drawdown limits. Once you hit the profit target, you pass to the funded phase. Most firms remove profit targets once you're funded, allowing unlimited profit potential. Some firms keep profit targets as ongoing requirements. Profit targets are typically 6-12% of account size.",
        "source": "Based on analysis of all prop firm data"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between evaluation and funded accounts?",
        "answer": "Evaluation accounts are practice accounts where you prove your trading skills. You trade with simulated money and must hit profit targets while staying within drawdown limits. Once you pass, you get a funded account with 'real' money. Funded accounts have different rules - usually no profit targets, but stricter drawdown limits and consistency requirements. Some firms offer 'straight-to-funded' accounts where you start with real money immediately without evaluation.",
        "source": "Based on analysis of all prop firm data"
    },
    {
        "question": "How do position size limits work?",
        "answer": "Position size limits control how many contracts you can trade simultaneously. Limits vary by account size: $25K accounts typically allow 1-5 contracts, $50K accounts allow 3-10 contracts, and $100K+ accounts allow 5-20+ contracts. Some firms use micro-scaling where you can trade more micro contracts (e.g., 10 micros = 1 mini). Position limits help manage risk and prevent overleveraging. Larger accounts get more position flexibility.",

    },
    {
        "question": "What are daily loss limits and how do they work?",
        "answer": "Daily loss limits (DLL) are the maximum amount you can lose in a single trading day. They're usually 2-6% of account size. For example, a $2,000 DLL on a $50K account means you can't lose more than $2,000 in one day. Some firms have no daily limits, only total drawdown limits. Daily limits help prevent catastrophic losses and encourage disciplined trading. Limits may be intraday (real-time) or end-of-day (calculated at close). Hitting DLL will disallow you from trading until the next day.",

    },
    {
        "question": "What are activation fees and when do you pay them?",
        "answer": "Activation fees are one-time charges when you pass evaluation and get funded. They range from $0 to $149. Some firms have no activation fees (FundedNext, FundingTicks, Lucid, MFFU), while others charge $85-149 (Apex, Alpha Futures, Topstep, TPT). You only pay activation fees once when moving from evaluation to funded. Some firms offer special promotions that waive activation fees. Consider activation fees when calculating total costs to get funded.",

    },
    {
        "question": "How do reset costs work when you fail evaluation?",
        "answer": "Reset costs are fees to restart your evaluation if you hit drawdown limits. Costs vary by account size and firm: $45-477 for most firms. Some firms offer free resets for evaluation accounts, while others charge the same price as a new account. Reset costs are typically the same, or lower than buying a new evaluation.",
        "source": "Based on analysis of all prop firm data"
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the minimum trading day requirements?",
        "answer": "Minimum trading days prevent passing evaluation with a single lucky trade. Requirements range from 1-5 days: Apex and Tradeify (1 day), Topstep and MFFU (2 days), FundedNext and FundingTicks (3 days), TPT (5 days). Some firms have no minimum days but use consistency rules instead. Minimum days ensure you demonstrate trading ability over time rather than getting lucky once. Firms with shorter minimums allow faster funding but may have stricter consistency rules.",

    },
    {
        "question": "How do payout rules work across different firms?",
        "answer": "Payout rules vary significantly: Most firms require 5-10 trading days before payouts, with minimum daily profit requirements ($50-300/day). Minimum payouts range from $200-4,500. Some firms have maximum payout limits ($1,000-100,000), while others have no limits. Profit splits range from 80-100% to the trader. Some firms use progressive structures (Topstep: 100% up to $10K, then 90/10) or withdrawal caps (FundedNext: caps until 5 payouts, then 100%).",
