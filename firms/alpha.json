    {
      "question": "How do payouts work?",
      "answer": "Payouts are available after 5 trading days with a minimum of $200 profit per day. You keep 90% of profits with a 10% split to Alpha Futures. Minimum payout is $1,000 with a maximum of $15,000.",
      "source": "https://alphafutures.com/"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the daily drawdown limit?",
      "answer": "The daily drawdown limit is 2% of your account balance. This provides flexibility as your account grows while maintaining risk management.",
      "source": "https://alphafutures.com/"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there an activation fee?",
      "answer": "Yes, there is a $149 activation fee for funded accounts. This is a one-time fee paid when you pass the evaluation phase.",
      "source": "https://alphafutures.com/"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I hit the drawdown limit?",
      "answer": "If you hit the maximum drawdown limit, your account will be reset. You can purchase a reset for the same price as a new evaluation account.",
      "source": "https://alphafutures.com/"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the consistency rule?",
      "answer": "The consistency rule requires you to maintain profitable trading days. For evaluation accounts, you need to maintain 50% consistency to pass to the funded phase.",
      "source": "https://alphafutures.com/"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I trade during news events?",
      "answer": "Evaluation accounts have no news-trading restrictions. Advanced Qualified funded accounts are permitted to trade news. Standard & Zero Qualified funded accounts must not execute orders +/-2 minutes around high-impact events, but may hold positions. Violations void profits in the 4-minute window.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the minimum trading days to pass evaluation?",
      "answer": "Zero Plan accounts can pass in 1 day with no consistency requirement. Standard & Advanced evaluation accounts require 2 days minimum due to the 50% consistency rule. Your biggest day cannot exceed 50% of the profit target.",
