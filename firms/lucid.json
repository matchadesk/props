    {
      "question": "What is the difference between LucidTest and LucidDirect?",

      "source": "https://lucidtrading.com/"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do payouts work?",
      "answer": "Payouts are available after 10 trading days with minimum profit requirements. You keep 90% of profits with a 10% split to Lucid. Minimum payout is $500 with no maximum limit.",
      "source": "https://lucidtrading.com/faq/"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is LucidScale?",
      "answer": "LucidScale is a feature that automatically raises your daily loss limit to 60% of your best end-of-day profit, allowing for more flexible trading as you become profitable.",
      "source": "https://lucidtrading.com/"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there an activation fee?",
      "answer": "No, there are no activation fees for Lucid accounts. You only pay the monthly subscription for LucidTest or the one-time fee for LucidDirect.",
      "source": "https://lucidtrading.com/"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I hit the drawdown limit?",
      "answer": "If you hit the maximum drawdown limit, your account will be closed. For LucidTest, you can restart the evaluation. For LucidDirect, you would need to purchase a new account.",
      "source": "https://lucidtrading.com/faq/"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I trade during news events?",
      "answer": "Yes, Lucid Trading does not have any restrictions on trading news. This applies to both evaluation and funded accounts. The firm just cautions about slippage and velocity logic.",
      "source": "https://lucidtrading.com/faq/"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the minimum trading days to pass evaluation?",
      "answer": "LucidTest evaluation accounts require 2 days minimum due to the 50% consistency rule. Your biggest day cannot exceed 50% of the profit target. LucidDirect funded accounts have no minimum days since they don't have consistency requirements.",
      "source": "https://lucidtrading.com/faq/"
