    {
      "question": "How do payouts work?",
      "answer": "Payouts are available immediately with no minimum trading days required. You keep 80% of profits with a 20% split to Take Profit Trader. Minimum payouts range from $2,500 to $4,500 depending on account size.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between evaluation and funded accounts?",
      "answer": "Evaluation accounts use end-of-day drawdown limits and require hitting profit targets. Funded accounts use intraday drawdown limits and have no profit targets, but have higher minimum payout requirements.",

    {
      "question": "Is there an activation fee?",
      "answer": "Yes, there is a $130 activation fee for funded accounts (if not omited due to a special offer). This is a one-time fee paid when you pass the evaluation phase.",
      "source": "https://takeprofittrader.com/"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I hit the drawdown limit?",
      "answer": "If you hit the maximum drawdown limit, your account will be reset. You can purchase a reset for $100 for evaluation accounts or $799-$1,499 for funded accounts depending on size.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the consistency rule?",
      "answer": "Take Profit Trader does not have a specific consistency rule. You are free to trade as you wish as long as you stay within the drawdown limits.",

      "question": "How do I move from Pro to Pro+ account?",
      "answer": "Once eligible for PRO+ upgrade, you'll receive an official invitation via email. This happens when you consistently withdraw meaningful profits over an extended period, or achieve $10,000 in profit within a single trading day on a PRO account. The setup takes 4-6 business days with no additional costs.",

      "question": "Can I trade during news events?",
      "answer": "Evaluation accounts have no explicit news trading rules. For funded PRO & PRO+ accounts, you must be flat/no orders +/-1 minute around CPI, NFP, FOMC minutes, plus Crude-Inventory & Bond-Auction blocks for related products. Violation closes the account.",

      "question": "What is the 'buffer zone' in a PRO account and why keep it?",
      "answer": "You can withdraw 80% of profits once balance exceeds the max-drawdown by that same amount (e.g. $50K acct → need $52K). Keeping the buffer preserves drawdown room; pulling it early can restrict trading.",
